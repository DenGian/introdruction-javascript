### What is a dialog box (alert box)?
* explanation:
  * An alert dialog box is mostly used to give a warning message to the users. For example, if one input field requires to enter some text but the user does not provide any input, then as a part of validation, you can use an alert box to give a warning message.

Nonetheless, an alert box can still be used for friendlier messages. Alert box gives only one button "OK" to select and proceed.
